# Fabrizio Corrales :D

Software Engineer in the Bay Area focused on developer tooling and production systems.

I build infra that shortens feedback loops, improves correctness, and ships value users actually feel.

Currently building **Form Factor**, an iOS-first fitness app for workout tracking and real-time form feedback.

## **Form Factor**
iOS-first fitness app for workout tracking, vertical video, and real-time form scoring.

### **Why it matters**  
Most people lift without feedback. Trainers are expensive and not there for every rep. Form Factor closes that gap with camera-based cues and scoring that help users train better and avoid injury. An all encompassing fitness platform hitting the trinity of workouts,nutrition and sleep.

## 🎯 Impact
- Built reliability tooling and E2E test infrastructure for agent-style systems  
- Shortened developer feedback loops through automation and deterministic test runs  
- Shipped across backend and frontend with a bias toward performance and correctness  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages**  
TypeScript · JavaScript · Python · Go  

**Infra / Data**  
Postgres · Supabase · DuckDB · CI/CD · Observability  

**Frontend / Product**  
React · React Native · Expo · Next.js · Tailwind  



## 🧭 Now
- Shipping **Form Factor** MVP (vertical video + form scoring)  
- Going deeper on reliability, testing infrastructure, and observability  
- Open to product-adjacent and forward-deployed style work  



## 🤝 Open to
- Infra + product-adjacent roles  
- Early-stage teams that value shipping  
- User-facing or forward-deployed engineering work  


## 🧠 How I Think
- Optimize for time-to-signal over perfect abstraction  
- Ship → measure → iterate
- Bias to action, then let data correct the course
